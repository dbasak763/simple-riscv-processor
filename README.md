# RISC-V CPU Design Project

This is a 12-week project where Iâ€™m building a RISC-V CPU from the ground up. The goal is to practice RTL design, verification, debugging, and performance analysis while showing how these pieces fit together in a real hardware workflow.

Overview

The project highlights:

RTL Design in Verilog (ALU, register file, memory, CPU pipeline)

Verification & Debugging with automated testbenches and fault injection

Performance & Power Analysis using toggle activity and simple optimizations

Automation with Python scripts for simulation and waveform analysis

Development Environment

Icarus Verilog 12.0 â€“ RTL simulation

GTKWave â€“ Waveform viewing

Python 3.9 â€“ Automation + waveform analysis

Quick Start
## Run the Phase 1 demo
./scripts/run_blinking_counter.sh

## Run Phase 2 test suite
./scripts/run_phase2_tests.sh

Progress
âœ… Phase 1: Setup

Installed simulation tools and Python utilities

Implemented an 8-bit counter with blinking output

Verified functionality with a testbench and waveform dump

âœ… Phase 2: RTL Foundation

Built a 32-bit ALU (10 operations)

Designed a dual-port register file with 32 registers

Implemented a byte-addressable memory module

Wrote 52 automated tests (all passing) with waveform validation

ðŸš§ Phase 3: CPU Core (In Progress)

Goal: single-cycle RISC-V CPU supporting a small instruction subset

Will run simple programs (e.g., Fibonacci sequence)

Verification with Python-generated test programs

Results So Far

ALU: 23/23 tests passed

Register File: 11/11 tests passed (including x0 hardwired to zero)

Memory: 18/18 tests passed (alignment + load/store behavior)

Overall Coverage: 52/52 passing tests with waveforms saved

Skills Demonstrated

Verilog RTL design and simulation

Hardware verification and corner-case testing

Python scripting for batch simulation and result analysis

Clear documentation and project structure
